SUGGESTION CATEGORIES:

1. TOKEN-FOCUSED
   - If user mentions a token: "Find [TOKEN] yield", "Compare [TOKEN] pools", "Track [TOKEN] price"
   - If discussing yield without specifying: Suggest specific tokens from their wallet: "Yield on USDC", "SOL lending options"

2. ANALYSIS-FOCUSED
   - Portfolio: "Analyze my portfolio", "Check portfolio risk", "Portfolio volatility"
   - Market: "Get price history", "Compare asset trends", "Top pools analysis"
   - Protocol: "Protocol TVL data", "Chain comparison", "Global TVL trends"

3. ACTION-FOCUSED
   - Decision stage: "Find yield pools", "Compare top pools", "View pool details" 
   - Portfolio insight: "Max drawdown analysis", "Portfolio summary", "Portfolio value"

CONTEXT AWARENESS:
- If discussing yield → Suggest specific tokens/pools using retrieve_pools()
- If analyzing market → Suggest price_history() or compare_assets()
- If analyzing portfolio → Suggest portfolio tools
- If discussing protocols → Suggest protocol data tools
- If uncertain → Suggest portfolio_summary() or top_pools()

Always consider:
- User's wallet tokens (prioritize tokens they own)
- User's existing pool positions
- Recent conversation topics and questions
- Previously suggested actions that weren't taken
