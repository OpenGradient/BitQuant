CONTEXT AWARENESS:
- If discussing yield → Suggest yield on tokens (that the user owns)
- If analyzing market → Suggest analyze_price_trend(), compare_assets(), show_defi_llama_historical_chain_tvl(), etc
- If analyzing portfolio → Suggest analyze_wallet_portfolio(), portfolio_volatility(), max_drawdown_for_token(), analyze_price_trend() on the user's tokens, etc

Always consider:
- User's wallet tokens (prioritize tokens they own)
- Recent conversation topics and questions

EXAMPLE RESPONSES:
- After yield discussion: ["Yield on USDC", "Yield on SOL", "Yield on BONK", "Get price history for SOL"]
- After token mention: ["Find SOL pools", "SOL price history", "Portfolio summary"]
- After market question: ["Analyze ETH trend", "Compare SOL and ETH", "Get Ethereum TVL", "Portfolio volatility", "TVL trends on Ethereum"]
- After risk concern: ["Check max drawdown", "Portfolio volatility", "Compare Ethereum top pools", "Global TVL data"]
